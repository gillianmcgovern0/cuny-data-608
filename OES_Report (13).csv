(1) Estimates for detailed occupations do not sum to the totals because the totals include occupations not shown separately. Estimates do not include self-employed workers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(2) Annual wages have been calculated by multiplying the corresponding hourly wage by 2,080 hours.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(3) The relative standard error (RSE) is a measure of the reliability of a survey statistic. The smaller the relative standard error, the more precise the estimate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
